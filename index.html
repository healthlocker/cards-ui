          Regular exercise can boost your self-esteem and can help you
          concentrate, sleep, and look and feel better. Exercise keeps the
          brain and your other vital organs healthy, and is also a significant
          benefit towards improving your mental health.

          For James Kindler, the early years of his illness were, as he says,
          hard and confusing, because "nobody knew what was happening to me."
          Since receiving his diagnosis of schizophrenia over 30 years ago, he
          has found medication that manages his symptoms, a job he's passionate
          about, and hobbies he enjoys.
